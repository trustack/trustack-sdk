# Trustack Client SDK - https://trustack.io

This repo contains the client library for interacting with the Trustack network. The client library is used to execute Procedures on Trustack exec nodes, simplifying communication and encoding with Procedures. 
There is currently only a browser-based Javascript client library - we'll continue to work to add other frameworks as requested.
